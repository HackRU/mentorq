# MentorQ
A real-time ticket queue to get mentorship during a hackathon.

## Goals
- let mentors see incoming tickets without page reload
- let mentors pull tickets when their free to help hackers, instead of getting pushed
- let hackers ask for help without:
  + waste time checking to see if there is a mentor at the table
  + waste time waiting at the mentor table for a mentor is free
  + waste time waiting if there are no mentors on duty
  + having to leave their seats
- help hackathon organizers gain insight into
  + what are hackers asking for help with
  + when do they typically look for help
  + do we have enough mentors available for hackers when they need them
  + are hackers enjoying the mentorship experience
